			<h2>About Sitar</h2>
			<div><h3>
				<b>The Sitar is perhaps the best-known and <br>most popular classical instrument from India. <br>Initially known as Tri–Tantri Veena <br>(3–stringed instrument) in the Vedic times, <br>the Sitar is believed to <br>have been re-modelled and 
				re-christened (as “SITAR”) <br>by Amir Khusru, 
				<br>the Persian poet–musician in the middle ages.<br>

				Since then the Sitar has survived centuries, <br>grown in popularity and gone through structural <br>changes to assume its present <br>form – that of a 20–stringed instrument <br>with a wooden stem and a <br>gourd (a vegetable grown in India) <br>shell for its sound box.<br>Apart from the 7 main strings <br>which are actually played, the 13 sympathetic <br>stings underneath resonate with each and every stroke, <br>creating a unique symphonic effect.<br>
A wire plectrum (mijrab) or striker is used for <br>stroking and the left hand fingers are used to <br>pull the strings to create gliding effects <br>(meends), which are characteristic of <br>Indian Classical Music.

						<h1>Indian Classical Music</h1>
			<H4>
				INDIAN CLASSICAL MUSIC is literally as old as the VEDAs. It originated in the vedic times ( the earliest <br>reference to it is in the Samaveda ) when mantras, slokas and stotras were chanted during worship in special <br>frequencies corresponding to musical notes or swaras. From these notes gradually developed <br> or the SAPTAK.


At the heart of the system of Indian Classical Music is the concept of the RAGA - a melodic form or entity, <br>defined by notes and their progression - in the framework of which the Indian Musician is free to IMPROVISE.<br>

​

Indeed, Indian Music not merely PERMITS IMPROVISATION IN MELODY AND RHYTHM, but THRIVES on it. <br>The framework of rhythm is provided by the TALA - a cycle of beats, the character of which depends on the <br>break-up of the MATRAS or Beats.<br>

Parts of a performance of this music are certainly composed, but a major portion is improvised at that instant - <br>which point to creativity of the highest order. Ragas are related to RASAS or MOODS, seasons, time<br> 
of the day/night.
